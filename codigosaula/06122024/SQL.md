# SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is divided into several subcategories, primarily categorized as: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Query Language (DQL), Data Control Language (DCL), and sometimes Transaction Control Language (TCL), each serving a distinct purpose within database management operations. 
## Breakdown of SQL subcategories:

### DDL (Data Definition Language):
Used to define the structure of a database, including creating, altering, and dropping tables and their columns. 
Commands: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX 
### DML (Data Manipulation Language):
Used to insert, update, and delete data within existing tables. 
Commands: INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE 
### DQL (Data Query Language):
Used to retrieve data from a database using SELECT statements. 
Command: SELECT 
### DCL (Data Control Language):
Used to manage user access and permissions within a database. 
Commands: GRANT, REVOKE 
### TCL (Transaction Control Language):
Used to manage transactions in a database, ensuring data consistency. 
Commands: BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK 

## Key points to remember:
When working with SQL, you'll likely use commands from multiple subcategories depending on the desired operation.
Understanding the different SQL subcategories helps you write efficient and accurate queries to manage your database.
